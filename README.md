# Multiclass Multilabel prediction For stack overflow Questions
A deep learning project developed using TensorFlow's Keras API, integrating advanced text preprocessing techniques with tools like NLTK, WordCloud, and word_tokenize. Leveraged TensorFlow's Tokenizer and sequence utilities, alongside LSTM, GRU SimpleRNN, and Dense layers with Dropout, BatchNormalization, and Embedding. The goal was to predict tags for given question texts. Utilized LSTM, GRU and RNN layers in the model to effectively capture sequential patterns and contextual dependencies within the text data, aiding in accurate prediction of tags for given questions. Used  ModelCheckpoint to save the model that has the highest validation accuracy. This is important because validation accuracy can fluctuate between epochs, and this ensure to keep the best-performing model, even if the last epoch's validation accuracy is lower.
